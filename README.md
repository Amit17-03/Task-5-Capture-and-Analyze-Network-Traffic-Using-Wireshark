# Task-5-Capture-and-Analyze-Network-Traffic-Using-Wireshark
Objective:
Capture real-time network traffic to analyze for troubleshooting, security assessment, and performance optimization.

Tool Used:
Wireshark â€“ Open-source protocol analyzer for detailed inspection of network packets.

Procedure:

Setup: Installed the latest Wireshark version and selected the correct network interface.

Traffic Capture: Started packet capture on the active interface, applying relevant capture filters (e.g., tcp, udp, specific ports).

Analysis: Stopped capture after gathering sufficient data. Used display filters to isolate packets, examined protocol details, addresses, and anomalies.

Issue Detection: Identified unusual traffic patterns, latency, and packet loss in specific streams.

Findings:

Captured live traffic (ARP, TCP, DNS requests).

Detected minor DNS resolution delays; no major security threats found.

Verified instances of network latency and packet loss.

Conclusion:
Wireshark effectively enabled in-depth diagnostics, helping pinpoint performance bottlenecks and ensuring network integrity.

Recommendations:

Conduct regular traffic monitoring.

Configure alert filters for suspicious activity.

Train staff for proactive network diagnostics.
